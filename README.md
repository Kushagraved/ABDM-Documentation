2) Coding Speed: Talking about ReactJS, If you want to create pages for your web application, you need to first create components and then additionally add them to the router whereas using NextJS can be very time saving for the developers, as if you want to add more pages to your web app, you just have to create the pages, and add them to the pages folder of the project directory, So that’s how NextJS speed’s up the coding process.
